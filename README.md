SEAMS is a machine-learning driven wearable application for primarily senior citizens who live alone. It runs on Intel Edison with Sparkfun Muscle Sensors, accelerometers, and other sensors with the aim of alerting senior citizens' remote family and other loved ones as soon as an accident is recorded on the wearable. 

Currently, SEAMS has support for accidents of the following kind:
- identifying when a person falls/trips
- undergoes a tonic clonic seizure (total body seizure)
- epilepsy.

Proposed supported accidents include:
- arrhythmia
- heart attack
